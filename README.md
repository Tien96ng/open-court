## _Description_ üìÉ
My favorite hobby that helped me expand my social and team building skills in life has been basketball. But since COVID-19 occurred, the majority of gyms and outdoor basketball courts have been closed. As the epidemic is coming to a steady end (hopefully), gyms and courts start opening up.

With that being said, this web app can be a centralized place to find open courts or just basketball courts in general.
